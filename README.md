# MonoGUI
Lightweight Graphical User Interface library for monochromatic GLCDs

![Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/19greg96/MonoGUI/master/picture.png)
Two screens showing capabilities. Left: Graph component with two signals, and many GraphLabel components. Right: MenuButton, Range, RadioButton, ToggleButton and Sprite components.

Uses ![MonoGFX](https://github.com/19greg96/MonoGFX) to draw components to a byte buffer.

Features:
 - Components can be added to multiple screens
 - Event based interaction
 - Optimized for small displays
 - Many components: Label, Button, ScrollButton, Range, ToggleButton, RadioButton, Menu and Graph
 - Supports fonts generated by ![The Dot Factory](https://github.com/pavius/the-dot-factory)

TODO:
 - More components
 - Better Graph component implementation
 - Support component width and height
